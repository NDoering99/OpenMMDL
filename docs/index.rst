**OpenMMDL** is an workflow, that allows an easy setup of **OpenMM** molecular dynamic simulations of protein-ligand complexes. **OpenMMDL** consists of:

*OpenMMDL_Setup* - A webserver tool that allows to modify the Protein and generate Input Files for MD Simulations.

*OpenMMDL_Simulation* - A script that performs a OpenMM MD Simulation with your Input files and further postprocesses the MD Simulation with MDTraj and MDAnalysis.
